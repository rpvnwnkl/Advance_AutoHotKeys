*Ellucian Advance AutoHotKeys*

This is a suite of programs built to accelerate data entry and processing in the Ellucian Advance application, a database application to help non-profits record information about their constituents (donors and alumni).

* **Library** contains common functions common to Advance. 

* **Advance** is mostly a store of older functions I built when first learning the tools/DB.

* **AGIS** contains directories for Bio and Gift specific tools

* **Prospect_Development** contains directories holding tools specific to Prospect Windows in the DB.

* **Apps** is a directory holding copies of compiled programs.
